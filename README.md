# 🚀 ETL Project with Docker & Airflow

## 🧾 Overview
This **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** project automates data processing using **Apache Airflow** in a **Dockerized environment**.  
It extracts data from multiple sources, transforms it for consistency, and loads it into a target database for analytics and reporting.

## ✨ Features
- **Data Extraction:** Pulls data from multiple sources including JSON files and databases.  
- **Data Transformation:** Cleans, formats, and processes data to ensure consistency and usability.  
- **Data Loading:** Loads processed data into target databases (e.g., MongoDB, SQL).  
- **Airflow DAGs:** ETL workflows are orchestrated using Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
